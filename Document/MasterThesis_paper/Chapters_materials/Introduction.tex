1.1 Background analysis
%在多少多少年，提出了机器人的概念
A robot[引用] is a machine or a device that performs a series of job automatically. It can accept human command, run preprogrammed procedures, and act according to the principles set out by artificial intelligence. Its task is to assist or replace human work, such as production, construction, or dangerous work.
