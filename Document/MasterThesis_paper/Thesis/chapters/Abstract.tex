In this paper, a method designed for making the humanoid robot walking is developed by using the DQN in reinforcement learning. Machine learning has demonstrated a promising feature in many fields including robotics. However the supervised learning algorithms are more often applied. But supervised learning like nerual networks always need a huge amount of data to train, which is sometimes not permitted in real situation. Although not much data is required in reinforecement learning, it need many attemps in its environment thus concluding a strategy. For a humanoid robot, it is not allowd to have to much bad attemps because a fell down may leads to the injury of a joints. In this paper an method that the robot learns walking with the help of human can avoid unnecessary fellings is proposed.
